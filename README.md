### About the Group
Each month, we will investigate 1 dataset from [Chicago's Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) -_a collection of publicly available datasets about Chicago provided by the City of Chicago itself_.  During each meeting, we will explore / clean data, pull out any interesting insights, practice communicating your findings through your own data visualizations and share them with others.

#### Group Rules
There are not many, but just a few to keep us focused on working and learning together.

1. Make sure you're adhering to Chi Hack Night's [Code of Conduct](https://chihacknight.org/code-of-conduct.html#:~:text=Chi%20Hack%20Night%20is%20dedicated,nationality%2C%20age%2C%20or%20religion.) as it will help us keep a great working and learning space for all.

2. Your analysis / visualizations should use our [featured dataset](###-This-Month's-Dataset:) in some form. If you find another dataset you want to join or compare it with, go for it! Just make sure you can at least demonstrate how you used our monthly data set.

3. If you are trying to replicate a visualization that you found somewhere, please sure to give credit to the original owner _(or at least the website where you found it)_. Since this is a learning / working group, replicating can be a great way to learn. But please be sure to give credit to the original owner or source of inspiration. _Example: If you store your analysis / viz on your own Github repo, make sure you give credit to your source directly in your code. If you're not sure the best way to do this, reach out to Sean!_

#### Do I Need to Know How to Code to Join
No! Not at all. This working group is open to all prior experiences. Whether you've been coding for years, an excel expert, or new to data and want to learn, this can be a good group for you. Check out the `help_me_get_started` folder in this repo if you're not sure where to start and would like some ideas!

#### What does a meeting look like
Each session is dedicated to being a working space to roll up your sleeves and start analyzing. Each night, we will share some quick hellos, recap how the group works for any new folks, and then start working. Feel free to work by yourself or in teams!

At the end of each meeting, we will save 5 - 10 minutes for anyone who would like to share what they've built. _We will also have a slightly longer share-out at the last session for each month_
