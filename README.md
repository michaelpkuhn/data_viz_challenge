# Data Viz Break-Out Group @ [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/)
## Working Group to Sharpen your Data Visualization Skills

### About the Group
Each month, we will investigate 1 dataset from [Chicago's Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) -_a collection of publicly available datasets about Chicago provided by the City of Chicago itself_.  During each meeting, we will explore / clean data, pull out any interesting insights, practice communicating your findings through your own data visualizations and share them with others.

#### Do I Need to Know How to Code to Join
No! Not at all. This working group is open to all prior experiences. Whether you've been coding for years, an excel expert, or new to data and want to learn, this can be a good group for you. Check out the `help_me_get_started` folder in this repo if you're not sure where to start and would like some ideas!
